Program steps:

Start of the program:
{

Server side:
-	Set up the server (arguments: port, password)
-	Server listens to some port as 8080 or so
-	Write in the terminal some response (waiting for a client etc.)
-	Start the server loop

Client side :

-	Client connects to server ( /connect 127.0.0.1 port password) //FUNCTION THAT CLIENT ALREADY HANDLES âœ…
-	Client can also connect like this : /connect 127.0.0.1 8080 abc user3 . In this case the user name, NOT NICKNAME, will be set to "user3".
	Let this to be implemented that if a client does not specify the name,
	give it some default name (username extracted from the connection and number it accoringly like rkurnava1, rkurnava2 etc.)

}

Loop:
{

	Clients connecting:
	{
	- 	Server autethenticates the password that the client provides
	-	If the password is correct, server extracts the username from the connection 
		and writes response that a user with a <username> connected and shows number of currently connected users
	-	 Save the user in a map
}

- 	Listen to user input, if itâ€™s a valid command, trigger it and response OK to user
	that sent the command, otherwise return ERROR message

Things to be aware of : 

-	if a user changes his nickname, keep the track if he was the operator or not and 
	that the commands can still be executed without error like : user cant be found etc.
-	after some client leaves a Channel, the channel deletes this client as a active nickname/user
